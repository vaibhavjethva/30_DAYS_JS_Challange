By the end of this Activities, you will:
- Implement and use linked lists for dynamic data storage.
- Use stacks for LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) operations and reverse data.
- Use queue for FIFO (First-In-First-Out) operations and simulate real-world scenarios.
- Implement binary trees for hierarchical data storage and traversal.
- Understand and use graphs for network representations and pathfinding (optional).
