By the end of this Activities, you will:
- Understand and create promises, including handling resolved and rejected states.
- Chain multiple promises to perform sequential asynchronous operations.
- Use async/await to handle asynchronous code more readably.
- Fetch data from public APIs using both promises and async/await.
- Manage multiple concurrent promises using 'Promise.all' and 'Promise.race'.
