By the end of this Activities, you will:
- Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
- Utilize while loop for iteration based on condition.
- Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Use loop control statements ('break' and 'continue') to control the flow of loops.
